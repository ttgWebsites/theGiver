					<li data-theme="d">The Giver is a fictional story that tells of a society that at first seems to be the image of a utopia (perfect world), 
					however as the story goes on it becomes clearer that it is a dystopia (imperfect world). The protagonist, Jonas, is a young boy who grows
					up in a place where everyone has the same opportunities and all seem relatively happy and content with their lives. When Jonas turns 12 he
					is given his role in society and learns he will replace a man known as "The Giver". The Giver holds all the lost memories of the society,
					memories of pain, sadness, color, difference, etc. He is responsible for these memories because if they were let loose upon the community,
					everyone would suffer greatly. Jonas comes to realize through the memories that he receives from the Giver that the life of sameness is perhaps
					not the best way to live as no one can actually achieve happiness, or satisfaction as well as sadness and suffering. He vows to return to a 
					world in which there is color, and life.</li>
