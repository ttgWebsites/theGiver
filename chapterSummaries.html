					<li data-theme="b">Chapters 1 - 2</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The protagonist is Jonas, a twelve-year-old boy, who lives in a very controlled utopian society.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">There are two-way microphone/loudspeaker systems to give orders to the people.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He remembers when a plane flew over the community, which was rare because it is restricted airspace.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The pilot was "released" from the community, or banished. The elderly are also released at a certain point, but it is not shameful.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He feels uneasy as he approaches a coming of age ceremony, where he will be assigned a job and enter adulthood.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">At dinner Jonas and his family share their feelings, a nightly occurrence.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">His seven year-old sister Lily talks about a kid she was angry at and his father, a nurturer, talks about an underdeveloped child at the nurturing center.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">We learn that children spend their first year in a Nurturing Center and are assigned parents (spouses are also assigned) and are given names. Each family can have one boy and one girl.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Fifty children are born each year to birthmothers who never see their children. There are no birthdays, each child graduates to the next age group each December.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas's father secretly looked at the underdeveloped child's name, Gabriel.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas expresses his surprise that his father broke a rule.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas tells his family about his feelings of uneasiness and anticipation toward the upcoming ceremony.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">His parents tell him that the Committee of Elders, the group that will assign Jonas his job, has been observing all the kids his age and consider their talents and passions when making their decision.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">They also tell Jonas he might be separated from his friends when he moves into his new career.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Children are given "comfort objects" which are just stuffed animals. Lily's is an elephant and Jonas's was a bear. However, it is said that the stuffed animals are imaginary creatures.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Chapters 3 - 4</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas's dad brings Gabriel home to stay at their house for the nights (they already have two children so they can't adopt him).</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas's sister Lily points out the characteristics that are more unique to this child, and coincidentally Jonas. In this case it is their eyes. We learn that it is not considered polite to make anyone feel alienated by pointing out his or her differences.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Lily wishes that she is given the position of birthmother as her career but her mother explains that it is not very glamorous. They have children for three years and are then sent to do manual labor.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas thinks about a time when he was reprimanded by the public speaker system. He had taken an apple home from school and was told that snacks should not be "hoarded."</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He brought it home because it appeared to change before his eyes and wanted to further observe it.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">In this society the older children are assigned mandatory volunteer (oxymoron) work to do. The purpose of this is so they can discover what they are passionate about.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas feels a sense of freedom when he does assorted volunteer work; it gives him a break from his structured life.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The places where he volunteers varies so much that he doesn't know which career he will be given.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">On this occasion he is working at the House of the Old, his friend Asher is already there.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He gives a bath to an old woman, Larissa. It is unlawful to see anyone naked except for the elderly and babies; Jonas notes the sense of trust he feels from her.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">They talk about the celebration of the release of an Elderly man, Roberto.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">She doesn't know where he went but she is sure that it is a pleasant place.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Chapters 5 - 6</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Each morning the family tells each other their dreams.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas dreams that he was back at the House of the Old, telling his friend Fiona to take off her clothes so he can give her a bath, like he did with the elderly woman.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">His mother tells him he is experiencing the "Stirrings," or the first feelings of sexual attraction. She gives him a pill to take every morning to regulate these feelings.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The pill removes the excitement he felt when thinking about the dreams, however Jonas feels a sense of adulthood now that he needs the "treatment" as other adults do.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The ceremonies for each age group begin and they discuss the different proceedings, except for Jonas's father, who is sitting with the other nurturers holding Gabriel.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">At seven they get jackets, at eight they begin their mandatory volunteer work, at nine they get bikes (the primary method of transportation in this society), at ten they get a haircut, and at eleven they receive their career Assignment.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas's father has gotten Gabriel a one-year extension before he is given to a family because he is underdeveloped. They will take care of Gabriel while he matures as long as they don't get attached to him.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">We learn that if a child dies, a "replacement child" is issued to the family. In this case the boy's name was Caleb, who drowned in the river.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">There is a ceremony to replace the dead Caleb with the new one, involving chanting his name</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas and his peers think about the Assignments they will receive. Jonas has faith in the Committee's meticulous decision making.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Chapters 7 - 9 </li>
					<li data-theme="d">When the ceremony for twelves' arrives each child is called up in the order that they were born to be given their Assignment.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">A speech is given to justify the Committee's decision for each Assignment.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas's friend Asher is given the position of "Assistant Director of Recreation" and the Chief Elder (basically the president) talks abut his cheerfulness.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas notes that everyone seems to be satisfied with his or her Assignments and it brings him relief.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">To everyone's surprise, Jonas is skipped over and the ceremony proceeds normally.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas wonders if he has done something wrong and is being punished.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Once everyone has been called up and given his or her Assignment, the Chief Elder turns to Jonas.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">She apologizes to him and tells him he has been unanimously chosen for the position of Receiver of Memory. The current one is old and needs to be replaced before he dies.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">She reveals to him the many requirements to be chosen, such as the "Capacity to See-Beyond." Jonas doubts he has this ability but then remembers the way the apple changed when he looked at it.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">She tells him that he will experience pain, something that has been eliminated from the community.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">She also tells him that the last child selected to become the new Receiver failed.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The community chants his name in a ceremony of acceptance as the new Receiver.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas immediately feels alienated from the community; even his family treats him differently although his parents tell him they are proud.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He learns that the previous selection for the receiver is in a state of disgrace.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas is even held to a different set of rules now. He does not need to adhere to the sense of politeness that the community is strictly bound to.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He can ask any question of anyone and is allowed to lie, and cannot have access to medication unless he is sick.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He cannot talk about his training, dreams, or ask to be released from the community.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Chapters 10 - 11</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas goes to the current Receiver of Memory's home in the Annex of the House of the Old for instruction.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">His home is locked, much nicer than usual, and is filled with books, which the community does not have access to.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The current Receiver of Memory says that he is going to telepathically transmit his memories to Jonas. These memories are of the world and of things that do not exist in the community, going back for hundreds of years.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He turns off the microphone/speaker system, which no one else can do. This shows that he and Jonas are indeed above the rules of the community.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He begins with the memories of snow, sledding, hills, sunshine, and sunburns.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Weather is now regulated to maximize the harvest of crops and all hills have been flattened to make for easily navigated terrain. The flattening of hills also represents the uniform of the community.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He gives Jonas the experience of sunburn when he asks about pain, which he has never felt.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas wishes these things still existed in the community today.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The man tells Jonas to call him the Giver because Jonas is now the Receiver of Memory.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Chapters 12 - 13</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas obeys the rule about not discussing his training with anyone with ease. His family knows he doesn't dream often so he is not pressed to share in the mornings.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas notices his friend Fiona's hair change as he saw the apple did. He explains this to the Giver and is told that he is beginning to see colors; in this case it is red.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas thinks about the sled and realizes that it is also red.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The Giver explains the absence of colors to Jonas as a way to regulate other things.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas wishes that he could see the world as it was meant to be seen, that colors should not have been removed.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas grows frustrated with the incomplete outlook others have on life.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He begins to see in color and tries to get his friend Asher to also, but is unsuccessful.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The Giver gives Jonas a memory of sorrow and mourning as poachers kill an elephant.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He tries to get his sister to understand that her "comfort object" is a real animal by giving her the memory, but he cannot.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas realizes that people could make the wrong decisions if they had the freedom to choose their spouses and career but still misses free will.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The Giver tells Jonas that his life will revolve around the memories he carries. He had a spouse once, but family life is hard because they do not understand and he cannot share anything with them.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">As the Receiver of Memories he will have to advise the Committee from time to time, but will mainly have to bear the burden of all the memories he carries.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The community cannot handle the memories. When the previous Receiver failed, her memories were transmitted to the community until they were removed. They spent the time in misery.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He also tells Jonas that knowledge is meaningless without experience.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas is curious about the pain the Giver feels from the memories.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Chapters 14 - 16</li>
					<li data-theme="d">To help Jonas understand the pain that the memories bring the Giver gives him a memory of intense pain.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">It is of sled ride, again, but in this memory the person on the sled crashes and breaks their leg.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">This is the first time Jonas has ever experienced real pain, and on top of that he isn't allowed medicine to take the pain away.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas now realizes how alienated he has become from everyone else, they have never experienced any of the things Jonas is now going through.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas is given more memories filled with pain.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The Giver explains to Jonas that it is important for these sensations to be remembered to guide the decisions of the Committee.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">According to the Giver being Receiver of Memories is so respected and praised because the Receiver keeps all the memories the people don't want.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas still believes that these memories should belong to everyone.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas's father is worried that Gabriel will be released because he cannot sleep through the night.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">His father also mentions a Birthmother is carrying twins and that one will be released if they are identical.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas offers to take care of Gabriel for the night.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">When Gabriel cries Jonas consoles him by patting him on the back. While doing this he thinks of a memory of calming sale ride that the Giver gave him.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He accidentally gives this memory to Gabriel, but he has stopped crying. He stops but then continues and gives him the entire memory, unsure of whether or not it was the right thing to do.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The Giver transmits the horrible experience of war to Jonas, with images of death. He cannot bear the pain and wishes to quit his training.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He can't bring himself to do it, but the Giver gives him more pleasant memories.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The Giver transmits his favorite memory to Jonas, a family of grandparents, parents, and children, on Christmas. Jonas has never known grandparents or the feeling of love that he feels between them.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">At home, Jonas asks his parents if they love him. They respond saying that they are proud of him and enjoy his company, but they don't love him (remember these are assigned parents, not actual, biological parents).</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas thinks about how things would be different if they had memories while transmitting pleasant memories to Gabriel.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas stops taking his pill that suppresses the "Stirrings."</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Chapters 17 - 18</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas enjoys the dreams and feelings that come with the "Stirrings." He realizes that only he has true feelings.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas's friends are playing a warlike game of good guys and bad guys. It brings back the memories of the horrible battlefield, but they could never understand.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Gabriel has learned to walk now, and his presence actually comforts Jonas.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas's father speaks of the upcoming birth of the twins, which are indeed identical. The one that weighs less will be released.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas and the Giver discuss the previous failed Receiver of Memories: Jonas is curious what happened.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The Giver tells Jonas that her name was Rosemary and she was intelligent like Jonas.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">She enjoyed the pleasant memories but desired to receive more difficult emotions.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">She couldn't handle these emotions and she applied for release.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas asks the Giver what would happen if he drowned in the river.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He is told that all of the memories that he has received would be shared with the people. However, the Giver believes that he could help the Community to understand and deal with these emotions.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He tells Jonas that he will think about it, but to stay away from the river.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Chapters 19 - 20</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas tells the Giver that he is curious about release. The curiosity is sparked by his father's mention of the twin children.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The Giver tells Jonas that as the new Receiver of Memories he now has access to any information he wants. He can even watch video of the release if he wants to.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He agrees and watches in horror as his father gives a lethal injection to the smaller twin and deposits the body in a garbage chute. The image of the dead baby recalls the memory of the battlefield and a soldier he watched die.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The Giver talks about Rosemary's release and says that she chose to administer the injection to herself.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas now refuses to go home to his family after watching the video and the Giver allows him to stay the night.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He sees his father as a murderer and a liar. He even thinks of his friend Fiona who works at the House of the Old, and how she must kill them too.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The Giver tells Jonas that they do not see the horror and outrage in their actions because they do not feel like Jonas and the Giver do. Jonas has already realized that only he feels real feelings.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Through his reaction, Jonas has convinced the Giver that the people need to experience these memories and powerful emotion.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">They devise a plan for Jonas to leave the community. The night before the Ceremony, Jonas will take his bike and an extra set of clothes and hide by the river. The Giver will send a car to visit a community outside theirs and he will hide Jonas in it. To cover it up, the Giver will tell the Community that Jonas drowned in the river.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas asks the Giver to go with him, but he tells Jonas that he is too weak to make the journey and he must stay behind to help the people deal with the memories anyway.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The Giver plans to give Jonas memories of courage and strength to give him bravery for his escape attempt for two weeks. He also tells Jonas that he will be with his daughter Rosemary, revealing that the previous Receiver was his daughter.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Chapters 21 - 23</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas abandons the plan when his father tells the family that Gabriel will be released the next day.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Breaking several rules, he grabs clothes, food, and his dad's bike and leaves that night, putting Gabriel in the child's seat on the back of the bike.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He rides all night to get away from the town and is pursued by planes.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He gives Gabriel memories of exhaustion, to sleep, and cold to them both so their heat signatures do not show up.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">As they get farther from the Community, the terrain changes and the planes fly over less frequently.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jonas sees the natural beauty of the world but at the risk of starvation.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Food is hard to come by but Jonas realizes that in the Community he would be well fed but Gabriel would have died and he would still be yearning to see the beautiful colors of the world.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">They are cold and hungry but Jonas uses the memory of sunshine to gather strength.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He cares only for Gabriel's safety. He remembers his family, friends, and the Giver. This helps him climb a tall, snow-covered hill.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Once at the top, Jonas finds a sled and recognizes the sight.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He sees a village at the bottom and steers himself and Gabriel toward it in the sled.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He recalls the memory of love and is sure it exists in those houses. He hears singing ahead and in the village, but also thinks he hears music coming from behind him. This symbolizes the change he has caused in his Community</li>
