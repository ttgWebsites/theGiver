					<li data-theme="b">Though Lowry tries to eliminate any gender distinctions from the characters in the utopia minus the
					obvious physical differences, they're still some minor stereotypes that still exist, explain.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">In the novel though boys and girls are treated much the same while growing up, there is still one distinction.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The young girls wear hair ribbons until age nine, the ribbons are the only decorative item mentioned in the novel.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">It seems as if the hair ribbon is left over from the time before sameness as a stereotypical accessory for females.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Another stereotype seen is when Jonas learns from the Giver that the previous receiver of information was a girl.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The giver describes her as beautiful and delicate, and explains that he had difficulty giving her the painful memories because he did not want her to suffer.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">This shows that women are still viewed as more sensitive than man, and in a different class.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jonas even expresses these views when he remarks that he would never want Fiona, his favorite female, to experience the pain from the memories, yet he feels as if he can handle them and hold the burden, while a woman should not.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">How does the Giver change through his encounters with Jonas?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">When the Giver first meets with Jonas he seems prepared to do his job just like instructed by the laws of his community.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The Giver, despite his advanced knowledge of pre-sameness life, is not inclined to do anything to change the way of life in his community.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He does not feel the need to help provide others with the power of choice and individualism.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">However after the Giver begins his work with Jonas, he begins to gain a new view of his societies oppression and realizes that he in fact has power to make a difference.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The Giver's resolve changes and he recognizes that perhaps life before sameness was the correct way to live because at least people had a chance to experience the best aspects of life, even if it came with sadness as well.</li>
